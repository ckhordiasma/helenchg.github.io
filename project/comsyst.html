     <strong>[Project Overview]</strong> 
     </div>  
     <p>
This project was developed through the laboratory requirement of the ECE310 course. This infrared digital communication system, which consists of a transmitter and a receiver circuit was built by Elena Chong Loo and Lingtongyue Jin throughout the first five weeks of required laboratory. Two breadboards and electronics components, such as resistors, capacitors, op amps, etc., were bought from the part room at the school and used as part of the circuit. The main purpose of the laboratories were to provide the students a better understanding of how each subsystem of the digital communication system, such as the comparator, sampler, modulator, filters works. 
During every laboratory session, the authors designed, built, and verified the functionality of each stage using the equipment from B200 lab. Datasheets were also used to check the pin out of each chip used in the design part of the lab. As the project progressed, a schematic diagram were made for each components using PSpice OrCAD Capture. Also, two PIC16F690 chips were used in this lab. The provided code was programmed into the PIC using the MPLAB IDE software available free from Microchip.
