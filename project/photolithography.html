         <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
         </div>  
            
            <p>This project was done as an independent research during Spring 2012-2013 term under the supervision of Physics Professor Dr. Kirkpatrick. The idea of this project was to create a device that can act as a traveling wave tube amplifier by growing a single carbon nanotube. My job was to improve the MEMS design using the integrated circuit design tool called LASI7, and then perform photolithography to get an array of the device on a wafer. 
             </p></h4>
         
         
            <strong>A Brief Description of the Photolithography Process</strong>
         <p>Several trials were made through out the manufacturing process of the device. The one trial that gave a good result is described as follow: <br>
             A 500Î¼m silicon wafer was used to deposit 800nm of titanium and 10nm of silicon dioxide on it. The wafer was then submerged in a dish with a dilute solution of 4 iron:16 water for 10minutes (this is to get a layer of iron nanoparticle for the grow of carbon nanotube). Then, the wafer was laid on the baker at 95 celsius for a minute. After that, the wafer was spun with a special spinner with photoresists applied on it to ensure that the photoresists covered the entire surface of the wafer. Then, the wafer was exposed with the mask of device array and baked again. Followed by submerging the wafer in a solution of 30mL developer with 90mL of distilled water to remove the not-needed photoresist. The wafer was then rinsed with distilled water and spun to air-dry. Then, a standard solution of hydrofluoric acid, peroxide, and water was used to etch away the titanium that is not needed for 5 seconds. Finally, the wafer was rinsed and spun again. Pictures of the process are shown below.
