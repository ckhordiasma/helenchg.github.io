     <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
     </div>  
     <p>
This is my final project for the Mechatronics class. Me and my partner worked on it for a week. I mainly worked with the hardware and did a small amount of programming. My partner wrote the algorithm for the interface. We used a microchip microprocessor and programmed with MPLAB in C.
