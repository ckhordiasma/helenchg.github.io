         <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
         </div>  
            
            <p> This senior design project was done in conjunction with the Oakley Observatory on campus and its advisor Dr. Richard Ditteon of the Rose-Hulman Physics and Optics Department (client). Specifically, the project focused on one of the Richey-Chretien telescope in the Observatory and its control system, the Telescope Interface Module (T.I.M.). The important fact is that the telescope is unsuable without this control box. The T.I.M. is prone to failure and the existing replacements in the market are costly and have features that our client does not need. The goal of this project was to design a more economical control box that comes with its own software for remote control of the telescope. Our solution uses an Arduino Mega as the brain of the control box. It has the ability to turn the cooling fans, measure the ambient temperature, the internal temperature of the primary mirror, the temperature of the secondary mirror, and control the primary mirror motor. In order to tie everything together, the team built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows remote control of the telescope with this new hardware design. <br>   
            My main tasks in this project were to work on designing the hardware for the replacement control box, building the GUI, and interconnecting the hardware with the software, while my teammates worked on reverse engineering the original control box.
