     <p>
                  This project is based on [1]. Many of the parameters were modified for fabrication. I chose to do this project for my Electromagnetic Metamaterials class because of my interest in wireless power transfer as a final project. We were given two weeks to finish and present our project. 
         How does the system work? There are two kinds of wireless power transfer: radiative and non-radiative. The radiative one uses antennas that need to radiate with high power, which can damage the surroundings. However, in this case, we are using a non-radiative power transfer method which relies on the near-field coupling between two inductive coils. The drive coil or the transmitter coil creates the magnetic field and the receiver coil, which is a small distance away and is physically detached from the transmitter coil, gets an induced magnetic field as a product of the flux from the magnetic field created by the transmitter coil. This is using the principle of a transformer. They are magnetically coupled.
         In the near-field, we have a magnetic evanescent field, which is a small magnetic wave that decays 
         exponentially with respect to proximity to the coil. 
         At this region, the electric and magnetic fields are decoupled. 
         The idea of this project is that since the magnetic evanescent field is decaying exponentially away from the coil, 
         in order for the receiver coil to get some of the flux, they must be placed closed to each other. However, adding a single negative metamaterial, in this case a negative permeability, it can amplify the magnitude of the magnetic evanescent wave. Thus, yielding a stronger coupling and efficiency of the overall power transfer. 
         The result of my metamaterial gave a 35% increase in wireless power efficiency at 220MHz compared to the bare coils.
