     <strong>Project Overview</strong> 
     </div>  
     <p>
         Originally, it was a one person project. Upon arrival at the Hackaton, two of my best friends decided to join me as a team to build an LED dress that could be controlled by anyone who owns a Leap-Motion sensor via the internet. It is then that our 32-hour challenge begun. My partners worked with the data coming from the Leap-Motion sensor to produce different pattterns and colors based on different hand gestures. I worked on the hardware part, mainly configured hardware communication of the Raspberry Pi with the LED strip, prepared the dress for the show, and setup the raspberry pi connection for receiving the commands to control the LED dress.
         We were one of the HackIllinois 2015 winners. We were awarded the "Trunk Club's Most Innovative Way to Connect to Someone" prize.
