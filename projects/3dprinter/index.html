     <strong>Project Overview</strong> <br>
         <p>My first summer at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2013, after doing my work, I took a break and read an article about 3D Printing from a magazine. Afterwards, I immediately when online to learn more about the technology and the how-to to build my own 3D printer. After reading about the reprap community, I ordered all the necessary materials and 3D printed the parts with a 3D printer from the ECE department shop with the help of the ECE department technician. It took me a week to assemble the printer and another week to calibrate it perfectly to produce good prints. </p>
