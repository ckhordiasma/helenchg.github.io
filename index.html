                    <p>
                        Hello! This is Elena Chong, from Panama City, Panama. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with minors in Robotics and Mathematics from the <a href= "http://www.rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, Indiana, United States<br><br>
                        
                        I am currently dedicating my time to promote the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker culture</a> in Panama. I am working with a group of highly passionate educators to change the face of education. I founded my company <a href = "https://www.tinkerall.com/"> Tinkerall</a> to provide Spanish speaking countries an online platform with educational tools to teach students to learn by making, creating, and building. <br><br>
                        
                        In the summer and fall of 2015, I was a research intern in the <a href = "https://embodied.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">Embodied Interaction group</a> at the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, worked under the supervision of <a href = "https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/juergen-steimle/">Dr. Jurgen Steimle</a>. 
                        
                        Previously, I was a research intern in the <a href= "http://lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu/">Lewis Research Group</a> at Harvard University. For the first two weeks, I joined <a href="http://www.electroninks.com/">Electroninks</a>, a spin-off from the lab, where I helped with sourcing components for the educational product in Shenzhen, China. For the rest of the summer, I worked at <a href = "http://www.voxel8.co/">Voxel8</a>, a 3D printing start-up working on the world's first 3D electronics printer (another start-up from <a href = "http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/jalewis">Professor Jennifer Lewis</a>).
                        
                        <br><br>Academically, I like to research and develop innovative interfaces to ease our interaction between our digital information and physical world. 
                        My research interests are human-computer interaction, wearable technology, and augmented interfaces. 
                        Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have done research and projects on asteroid photometry, photolithography, wireless energy harvesting, 3D printing, sensor and haptic technology, and microwave device coupler fabrication.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I believe that combining science, engineering, mathematics together with arts, we can create very innovative approaches to problems. Over the past few years, I have done some creative work (filmmaking) that mixes a wide variety of themes.
