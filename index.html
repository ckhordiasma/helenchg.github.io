                   <p> Welcome to <strong>Elena Chong Loo's </strong>portfolio Homepage! </p> 
                    <p>

                        I am an undergraduate at the <a href= "http://www.rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, the #1 ranked undergraduate engineering school... that does not have a doctorate program... in the United States. I am currently a third-year senior, majoring in electrical engineering, minoring in robotics and mathematics. <br><br> I am very passionate about learning new things and teaching people what I know. That's why I founded the Rose MakerLab, a sharing, learning, and teaching community where Rose-Hulman students can share and work on projects of their own interest with other students of diverse skills. <br><br>  I am obsessed with the 'sci-fi' technology shown in the Iron Man movies, specifically Tony Stark's interactive lab. My goal is to develop innovative interfaces to ease our interaction between our physical world and our digital information. My research interests are interactive technology and human-computer interface design. Thoughout my undergraduate, I have done research and projects on asteroid photometry, photolithography, energy harvesting, 3D printing, sensor and haptic technology, and microwave devices coupler fabrication.
                        <br>
                        In addition, I believe that mixing art, science, engineering, and mathematics, can create very similarly innovative approaches. Over the past few years, I have done several short videos related to science and engineering, which you can check out at my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8K6zTCAZtnK1vV3HmhknIQ">filmmaking youtube channel.</a>
