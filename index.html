                   <p> Welcome to <strong>Elena Chong Loo's </strong>portfolio Homepage! </p> 
                    <p>

                        I am an undergraduate at the <a href= "http://www.rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, the #1 ranked undergraduate engineering school that does not have a doctorate program in the United States. I am currently a rising senior, majoring in electrical engineering with a minor in robotics and mathematics. <br><br>
                        Currently, I am an intern in the "Embodied Interaction" group at the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics working under the supervision of Dr. Jurgen Steimle. <br><br>
                        My goal is to develop innovative interfaces to ease our interaction between our digital information and physical world. My research interests are human-computer interaction, wearable technology, and augmented interfaces. Thoughout my undergraduate, I have done research and projects on asteroid photometry, photolithography, energy harvesting, 3D printing, sensor and haptic technology, and microwave devices coupler fabrication.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe that mixing art, science, engineering, and mathematics, can create very similarly innovative approaches. Over the past few years, I have done some creative work that mixes a wide variety of fields together with science and engineering, which you can check out on my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8K6zTCAZtnK1vV3HmhknIQ">YouTube channel.</a>
