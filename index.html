                   <p> Welcome to <strong>Elena Chong Loo's </strong>portfolio Homepage! </p> 
                    <p>

                        I am an undergraduate at the <a href= "http://www.rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, the #1 ranked undergraduate engineering school... that does not have a doctorate program... in the United States. I am currently a rising senior, majoring in electrical engineering, minoring in robotics and mathematics. <br><br> I am very passionate about learning new things and teaching people what I know. That's why I founded the Rose MakerLab, a sharing, learning, and teaching community where Rose-Hulman students can share and work on projects of their own interest with other students of diverse skills. <br><br>
                        My goal is to develop innovative interfaces to ease our interaction between our physical world and our digital information. My research interests are interactive technology and human-computer interface design. Thoughout my undergraduate, I have done research and projects on asteroid photometry, photolithography, energy harvesting, 3D printing, sensor and haptic technology, and microwave devices coupler fabrication.
                        <br>
                        In addition, I believe that mixing art, science, engineering, and mathematics, can create very similarly innovative approaches. Over the past few years, I have done several short videos related to science and engineering, which you can check out at my <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8K6zTCAZtnK1vV3HmhknIQ">filmmaking YouTube channel.</a>
