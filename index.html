                   <p> Welcome to <strong>Elena Chong Loo's </strong>personal website! </p> 
                    <p>

                        Hello! This is Elena Chong, from Panama City, Panama. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with minors in Robotics and Mathematics from the <a href= "http://www.rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>, the #1 ranked undergraduate engineering school that does not have a doctorate program in the United States.<br><br>
                        
                        I am currently dedicating my time to promote the maker culture of learning by doing and sharing knowledge in Panama. Working with a group of highly passionate educators to change the face of education. I founded my company Tinkerall S.A. to provide spanish speaking countries an online platform with educational tools to teach students to learn by making, creating, and building and to share their own knowledge with their community.
                        
                        In the summer and fall of 2015, I was a research intern in the <a href = "https://embodied.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">Embodied Interaction group</a> at the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, worked under the supervision of <a href = "https://embodied.mpi-inf.mpg.de/people/jurgen-steimle/">Dr. Jurgen Steimle</a>. <br><br> 
                        
                        Previously, I was a research intern in the <a href= "http://lewisgroup.seas.harvard.edu/">Lewis Research Group</a> at Harvard University. For the first two weeks, I joined <a href="http://www.electroninks.com/">Electroninks</a>, a spin-off from the lab, where I helped with sourcing components for the educational product in Shenzhen, China. For the rest of the summer, I worked at <a href = "http://www.voxel8.co/">Voxel8</a>, a 3D printing start-up working on the world's first 3D electronics printer (another start-up from <a href = "http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/jalewis">Professor Jennifer Lewis</a>).
                        
                        <br><br>My goal is to develop innovative interfaces to ease our interaction between our digital information and physical world. 
                        My research interests are human-computer interaction, wearable technology, and augmented interfaces. 
                        Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have done research and projects on asteroid photometry, photolithography, wireless energy harvesting, 3D printing, sensor and haptic technology, and microwave device coupler fabrication.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I believe that combining science, engineering, mathematics together with arts, we can create very innovative approaches. Over the past few years, I have done some creative work (filmmaking) that mixes a wide variety of themes.
