            <h4>Projects I am currently working on</h4>
                <p> I am currently working on a few projects while taking care of activities in clubs and class assignments. A few of them are: assembling another PRUSA i3 with my friend Igor, setting up the infrastructure for my first startup company with my friend Faye and some others in Panama, building a smart mirror, and starting a series of education youtube videos. I try to keep myself busy by learning new skills and perfecting old ones. Feel free to ask me anything about my current projects.

                    Here is a list of places I have traveled to so far. Traveling is a very good cultural experience. If you can, you should plan to travel more often with family and friends. Even if you are traveling for work, check if you have a few free hours to visit the city and learn about the culture.

                    Project I worked on with two other Rose-Hulman students at my first Hackathon hosted by Norwestern University (WildHacks 2014). It was a very good experience. Got to prototype a concept in less than 24 hours.

                    This is a picture of me taken during the night of New Year's Eve in 2013 inside a restaurant near Sephora in 44th street. That night, it was the first time I have seen very famous singers just feet from where I was standing. I touched PSY furry white coat! (Yeah, it's a bit creepy...) Carly Rae Jepsen was just a foot from where I was standing. It was a fence that separated her from me. After that night, I realized that they are just very succesful and talented people.
